# What is free work?

As a designer I find myself constantly want to improve my "productivity". Decisions are framed through the ideas of what skills are hireable and which skills are pointless. The idea is simple. "Am I sellable?." Every project is conceived and constructed with the end goal of creating something to make you seem more hireable or employable. What the fuck is that? This may be something that can end up in my portfolio to show people that I am in fact "creative" and "interesting", but it also serves a personal purpose of detaching creativity from an either finished, productive or monetary output.

    I WANT TO BE FREE!

In my never ending quest to find fulfillment and freedom from the constraints of modern existence I find joy in the perfectly curated micro spaces of websites. I am making another little micro space for me.
