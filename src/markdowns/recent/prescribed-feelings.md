# prescribed feelings

Open up whatever music streaming service you have (if you don't have one than good for you). Go to the "Discover" and select the first 4 albums. Play a song from each album at random and Let each track guide your clicking fingers. Using only shapes convey what the song is evoking. Then either make a composition with all of the shapes or choose one shape that feels like the best distillation.

# steps

1. Open up whatever music streaming device.
2. Go to the "Discover" option.

4. Choose one song and play it on repeat for 30 minutes.
5. Draw whatever you feel while listening.
