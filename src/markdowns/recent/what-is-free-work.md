# I. What is free work?

"Free Work" is an attempt explore new creativity frameworks for my personal growth. It is a form of "self love". In my never ending quest to find fulfillment and freedom from the constraints of modern existence I am using this small curated digital space to explore new personal relationships to the digital world, my creative process and personal productivity. As a designer I have utilized "creative thinking" into either a "finished product" or achieving percieved "monetary value". I feel that this narrow view of creative thinking is stunting me. It's preventing me from seeing more and I want to further open up my eyes and try to see more and experience more.

    In the pursuit of an endless and seemingly unachievable goal of "breaking free" I made a microsite.
